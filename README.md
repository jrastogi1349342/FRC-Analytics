This is a predictive and data analytics tool for teams at FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) tournaments. It can be run as a normal application or as an API, though I need to configure the database to work in conjunction with the API. 

All personal information in this project (eg. database username, password, API key) was stored in a class called Constants and removed from this version uploaded to Github. To use the tool, you must make an account in MySQL and make your own username and password. In addition, you must make an account in TheBlueAlliance and form an API key.
